## Introduction

Hello everyone! I am Amogh, and I am pursuing my undergraduate studies in chemistry. Unfortunately, the meticulous and rigorous curriculum leaves me with very little time and energy for hobbies. I mostly like to listen to music, play video games or go for a stroll in the campus in my scarce free time.

I ponder over a lot of things during the day which I would like to keep note of, either for sharing with others or for future reference. Initially I considered diary writing but it did not quite click with me. Hence, I decided to create this online journal on Github where I can jot down and elaborate on my thoughts and maybe share them with others as well.

The main idea in my mind is to currently create posts on topics of interest occassionaly, keeping it casual and free-spirited. Typing out long, well-though-out posts is definitely harder said than done, and I am not quite familiar with GitHub yet, but I will see what I can do. I do have a few posts ideas in mind. Hmm....

Anyways, that is all for this post. See you in the next one!
